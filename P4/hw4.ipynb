Your final system will go from natural language questions to their answers, computed from the database, via logical forms that are executed on the database. \n",

        "    - **entity predicates** (e.g. `kb-virginia`), which takes 1 variable argument and return true if the proper entity (e.g. `virginia`) is assigned to the variable.\n",
        "3. A **conjunction** (`and`) of multiple **literals** (e.g. `(city $w)` is a literal). A literal consists of a predicate with some number of variables as argument.\n",
        "4. [optional] An **existential quantifier** (`exists`), which takes as arguments all but one of the variables used within the conjunction, and the conjunction. `exists` is used if and only if more than one variable is used inside the `and` expression.\n",

        "Note: an alternative, more compact logical form representation would use entities directly when applicable, e.g. `(lambda $w (and (city $w) (in-rel $w virginia)))`. This would make the implementation of the logical form executor (which you'll complete in the next section) a bit more complex, but it would likely reduce the difficulty of learning the logical forms' structure. If you're interested, see [Liang 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4408) for one approach used in many recent systems which takes this even further to eliminate all variables and make existential quantification implicit, more closely paralleling natural language.\n",

This class tokenizes each question, and associated with each token a list of predicates that could possibly be used in the logical form, based on string matching predicate names against the word. To constrain the search space over possible logical forms, we will only allow predicates for a given question from the union of all its tokens' predicates.

You might be surprised at the accuracy; a few structural and lexical constraints can go a long way on this dataset, and it's also sometimes possible to get the correct denotation through an incorrect logical form (this will complicate things later on, when we learn from denotations alone).

A different version of this dataset, introduced by [Andreas et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01705), adds an `any` operation to the logical forms for yes/no questions, which maps empty denotations to \"no\" and non-empty to \"yes\", but this makes training from denotations (which we'll do later on) more difficult."

This setting, _training from denotations_, requires less supervision but introduces problems of search, delayed reward, and ambiguity, as there are many possible logical forms that can execute to a given denotation. We'll use a classic method, _maximum marginal likelihood_; if you're interested in other methods, see [Misra et al. 2018](https://dipendramisra.com/papers/mchy-emnlp.2018.pdf) and [Guu et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07926) for a survey and connections to policy gradient from reinforcement learning.\n",

While the training loss should consistently decrease, you may see fluctuations in denotation accuracy (both on train and dev) from epoch to epoch. However, you'll likely obtain training denotation accuracies >80% and dev denotation accuracies >70% at some point by epoch 5. Your maximal dev accuracy should be at least 63%, although there is again some variance due to the small dataset size, which is compounded by the variance from training from denotations. Our reference implementation obtained an average maximal dev accuracy of 80%, but ranged between 63% and 90% (over 40 trials). 10 epochs of training should take around 20-30 minutes."
